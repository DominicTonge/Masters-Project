 - Load the "Workspace" file first. This ensures that the code works 
	realtively smoothly.

 - "Testing and Results" is the main file containing the code that produced 
	the results

 - "Explanatory Plotting" contains code that produces figures that were used 
	to help explain the maths and techniques used.
